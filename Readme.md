#Arduino-In-AVR Studio 6.x
---------------------------

This project is an example of how one can convert the normal Arduino projects
to use the advanced and significantly more usable AVR Studio 6.x IDE.
Practially the Arduino IDE is simple and good. 

But for projects that still want to use the advantage of Arduino framework
and do not want to limit themselves with the contrains of the Arduino IDE or
Arduino Bootloader, this is the solution to all thoes looking out.

Althouh there have been many tutorials but I though having my own would not
hurt.
